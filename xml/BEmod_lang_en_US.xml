			<Text>Infiltration tactics emerged gradually during the later years of World War I.  Infiltrators are most potent when they unleash a Dirty Bomb.  The purpose of the Dirty Bomb is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_DIRTY_BOMB_STRATEGY">
			<Text>An Infiltrator is an extremely powerful unit. Unlike an Atomic Bomb, the Infiltrator can move from the city in which it is built and advance towards a player-owned city. It can attack a target within its range of 2 tiles, but is not permitted to attack tiles if the subsequent fallout would catch Barbarian allies. When the Infiltrator unleashes it's "dirty" Atomic Bomb, a 2 tile blast radius is afflicted.  Units within the blast radius are damaged or possibly destroyed, and cities will be severely damaged. The Infiltrator is automatically destroyed when it attacks in this manner. See the rules on Nuclear Weapons for more details.</Text>

				Who are you?  It doesn't matter.  Your name is a symbol; your identity a figurehead, a rallying cry.  Your people rose from rubble and will leave rubble in their wake.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				You are the leader of those that civilized folk call "barbarians".  The Barbarians are a rabble who care not for the trappings of society.  Living day to day, they range from place to place, destroying all in their path.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Mighty leader, your people long for a glorious tyrant to give direction to their strength.  Can you crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the women?  Can you bring down empires that have stood the test of time?
